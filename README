ValidatesAsPhoneNumber
======================

(000) 000 0000
(000) 000-0000
000.000.0000
000-000-0000
000-0000
000-000-0000x000 (extension can be up to 7 digits)
000-000-0000 x1234567 (extension can be up to 7 digits with or without leading space before 'x')
000-0000x000 (extension can be up to 7 digits)
